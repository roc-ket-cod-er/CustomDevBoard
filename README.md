I set off to build this devboard simply because I was tired of questioning whether it was the fault of the software or hardware. With the entire PCB pre-made and tested, we can remove hardware from the list of uncertanities. I also always wanted to make a battery-power GPS, so this can work for this, but if I get board of the GPS, it can always be reperporsed for almost any task, especiall with those 60+ availible GPIOs.
